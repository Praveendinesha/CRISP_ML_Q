        "\n",
        "In the \"Business Understanding\" phase of a data science or machine learning project, defining the business objective is a critical step.\n",
        "\n",
        "The business objective is a clear and concise statement that outlines what the organization aims to achieve through the project.\n",

        "It serves as the guiding principle for the entire project and helps align data science efforts with the strategic goals of the business.\n",

        "\n",
        "  Time constraints define the project's timeline and deadlines. These constraints can be driven by business needs, regulatory requirements, or market conditions.\n",
