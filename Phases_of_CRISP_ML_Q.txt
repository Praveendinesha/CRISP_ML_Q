#CRISP-ML-Q

CRISP-ML, or the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Machine Learning Quality, is a framework or methodology used in the field of machine learning to 
guide the development and deployment of machine learning models. It is used to ensure that machine learning projects are conducted in a systematic and quality-focused manner. 
It has six phases, they are:

1.Business Understanding (BU): 
In this phase, you define the business problem you aim to solve with machine learning. 
It involves 2 major key objectives they are BUSINESS OBJECTIVE AND BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS.

2.Data Understanding (DU):
Here, you gather and explore the data needed for the machine learning project. You assess data quality, structure, and availability.

3.Data Preparation (DP):
Data preprocessing and cleaning are performed in this phase. It includes tasks like feature selection, transformation, and dealing with missing data.

4.Model Building (MB):
In this phase, you select and train machine learning models based on the prepared data. Model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning occur here.

5.Model Deployment (MD):
Once the model is trained and validated, it's deployed in a real-world environment. This phase considers scalability, integration, and deployment strategies.

6.Model Monitoring and Maintenance (MM):
After deployment, the model's performance is monitored, and regular maintenance is performed. This phase ensures that the model remains accurate and up-to-date.

These six phases provide a structured approach to developing and deploying machine learning solutions while maintaining a focus on quality and business objectives.
