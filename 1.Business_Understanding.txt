------------BUSINESS_UNDERSTANDING:-------------
It represents the initial step in a data science or machine learning project, where you aim to gain a deep understanding of the business problem or opportunity that you are trying to address. 

Business understanding involves TWO KEY OBJECTIVES they are Business Objectives and Business Constraints.

==================================1) Business Objectives:==============================
In the "Business Understanding" phase of a data science or machine learning project, defining the business objective is a critical step. 
The business objective is a clear and concise statement that outlines what the organization aims to achieve through the project. 
It serves as the guiding principle for the entire project and helps align data science efforts with the strategic goals of the business.

EXAMPLES: 
i.Increase Revenue: 
  Develop a recommendation system that increases sales by X% within the next six months by suggesting relevant products to customers.

ii.Enhance Customer Satisfaction: 
  Build a sentiment analysis model to monitor customer feedback and improve customer satisfaction scores by X points over the next quarter.

=================================2) Business Constraints :=============================
Business constraints are limitations or restrictions that can impact the planning, execution, and success of a data science or machine learning project. 
Identifying and understanding these constraints is a crucial part of the "Business Understanding" phase, as they can significantly influence project scope, feasibility, and resource allocation

EXAMPLES:
i.Budget Constraints: 
  The project may be constrained by budget limitations, affecting the resources available for data acquisition, infrastructure, personnel, and tools.
  Understanding the budget constraints is essential for making decisions about the project's scale and complexity.

ii.Time Constraints:
  Time constraints define the project's timeline and deadlines. These constraints can be driven by business needs, regulatory requirements, or market conditions. 
  Failing to meet time constraints may have serious consequences for the business.

========================3.Success Criteria========================
We should record the success criteria before enters into te project for all Business, ML, Economic context.

i. Business Success Criteria:
Success Rate: The percentage of successful outcomes in business initiatives or projects.
Failure Rate: The percentage of unsuccessful outcomes in business initiatives or projects.

ii. ML (Machine Learning) Success Criteria:
ii.Success Rate: The accuracy of a machine learning model in making correct predictions.
Failure Rate: The rate at which a machine learning model produces incorrect predictions.

iii. Economic Success Criteria:
Success Rate: The rate at which economic policies lead to positive economic outcomes.
Failure Rate: The rate at which economic policies lead to negative economic consequences.

======================Other Main Points to take=======================
4. It is recommended to write objectives and constraints using 3-4 words.

5. Also it is recommended to use the DATA OPTIMIZATION TERMS. eg: Minimize, Maximize. 

======================6.Project Charter================================
This is the first document which gets prepared on any project.

This contains detail at High level
i.   High Level Product Characteristics.
ii.  High Level Project Requirements
iii. Summary Millestones
iv.  Summary Budget
v.   Key Stakeholders
vi.  High Level Risks
ATLAST MAINLY, THIS DOCUMENT MUST SIGNED BY A PROJECT SPONSOR
